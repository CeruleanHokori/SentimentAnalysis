# SentimentAnalysis
Experimentations with BERT for the creation of sentiment analysis models

This is a small project for experimentation with BERT model and sentiment analysis, using a dataset of tweets from kaggle. 

To execute the gui you can : Python gui.py 

In order to use the model you have to combine the files sentiment_v00* (using 7zip for instance)
